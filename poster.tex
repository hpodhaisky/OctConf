\sect{Abstract}

We believe that mathematical programming can be taught using surprising and
nontrivial examples. Short programs shall visualise an idea.  To learn how to
write correct code is easier with discrete problems where rounding errors
cannot conceal bugs.  The lack of certain data structures (lists with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ append, queues, \dots) in Octave leads to uglier code or wrong
asymptotic complexity for some problems (shortest paths, minimal spanning
trees, \dots). Visit \url{https://github.com/hpodhaisky/OctConf}

the rotational symmetry). The physical space $3\times 3\times 3$ is extended by
seven components to mark the number of the piece, leading
to $A x = b$ with $A\in\{0,1\}^{34\times 550}$, $x\in\{0,1\}^{550}$ and
$b=[1,\dots,1]^\top$ which is solved by backtracking.}
